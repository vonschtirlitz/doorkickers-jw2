<!--
REPLACING RESOURCES IN THE BASE GAME:
When loading a file, the "data/" suffix for each filename is replaced with the path for each active mod ("data_mod1/", "data_mod2/" etc.).
The first one that's found is loaded. If not found in a mod, it will fallback to the "data/" folder.
This means that a mod can replace any file existent in the base "data/" folder.
If two mods replace the same file, they are considered to be in conflict and cannot be used at the same time.

ADDING EXTRA RESOURCES:
To avoid conflicts, two mods should add extra resources using this xml.
The "filesystem_mount.xml" is the only file that's searched and loaded from all active mods.

Any resource file definition can be merged on top of the existing ones.
Example:
	<SoundDefinitions>
		<MountFile name="data/sounds/my_soundsdef.xml"> (make sure to use a different name for the existing xml, therefore avoiding conflicts)
	</SoundDefinitions>

<filesystem_mount>
